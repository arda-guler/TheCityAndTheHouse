# The City and The House
This is a small walking simulator I built on a tiny 3D first-person "engine" I have written based on PyOpenGL and pygame audio mixer. It is actually a modified version of the "engine" I used for [Kelaynak84](https://github.com/arda-guler/Kelaynak84), a combat flight simulator. 
The game is a short art-game to showcase it properly. The "engine" does not have name of its own as it's not really a full-fledged game engine as-is and I don't want to give it more credit than it deserves - I could call it the 
"Kelaynak game engine" I suppose, and this first-person version would be the "TCATH engine" or sth.

The graphics code itself that uses PyOpenGL can legitimately trace its roots back to [OrbitSim3D](https://arda-guler.github.io/OrbitSim3D-web/).

The name of the game is a reference to ["The City and The Stars"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_and_the_Stars).

## Game
It is a short multiple-endings walking simulator game. WASD to walk, mouse to look around.

Also, **EPILEPSY WARNING!!**, if you missed the first one.
